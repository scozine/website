    <h3>At the top of the viola, you will find the scroll. The scroll is the curly wood piece at the top. Then you will find the pegs. The pegs heplp you tune by tightening the string and changing the sound. After that, there is the fingerboard. The fingerboard is were you put your fingers to change the sound. Example you have open D and you put your first finger down and then it's E. Next there is the shoulder. It is the side of the viola. Then there is the bridge. The brige is a small piece of wood that holds the strings up. To continue there is the F holes. The F holes let the sound vibrations go into the inside of the viola to help create sound. Below the F holes you will find the fine tuners. The fine tuners also help tune your strings, but instead they help change the sound with tiny differents. The tailpiece and the fine tuner are connected. The tailpiece holds the strings and keeps them from falling off. The jaw rest is where you keep up the viola and put your jaw. The last piece is the button. The button holdsS everthing together and is located at the very bottom.</h3>
